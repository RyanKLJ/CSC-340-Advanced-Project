I decided to code a program which can solve a Sudoku.  I was going to code a simple game at first, such as Snake, but decided the Sudoku Solver would be better suited. I will be storing the values of the Sudoku in a two-dimensional array and use functions to determine which numbers are left.

Task #1:
Think of and complete all of the needed function declarations.

Task #2:
Complete the implementation and code for each function.

Task #3:
Create / import a Sudoku for any type of debugging.

Task #4:
Finish anything else needed.
